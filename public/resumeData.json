Since it was my first time building a website with someone, I was a bit nervous but once we got to working, she made the process stress free and fun. I'm sure I can be a bit demanding as a client (as I have a particular aesthetic in mind for my brand's website), but Dominique has been most patient and accommodating. The entire process has been very collaborative and you can tell she truly cares about her work and client satisfaction. She is very attentive to detail and great at interpreting my abstract descriptions. She's thoughtful about layout and successfully adapts designs to different platforms. Overall, she's a fantastic person to work with and I'd recommend working with her if one is looking to build their own website. ",
